Total time spent : 6 hrs

Setup 2 VM's on google cloud platform and setup firewall rules for the virtual machines. The mhn-admin VM and mhn-honeypot VM with Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP honeypot are deployed by following the instructions given.
Issues faced mhn-celery-worker exiting too quickly. Restarting all the services solved the issue.
Honeypot was left for running for 1 hour and multiple attacks were captured by the honeypot.
